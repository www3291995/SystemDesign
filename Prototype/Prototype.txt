Motivation

--Complicated objects(e.g., cars) aren't designed from scratch
	--They reiterate existing designs
--An existing(partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype
--We make a copy(clone) the prototype and customize it
	--Requires 'deep copy' support
--We make the cloning convenient(e.g., via a Factory)

Prototype
--A partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of

Summary

--To implement a prototype, partially construct an object and store it somewhere
--Clone the prototype
	--Implement your own deep copy functionally; or
	--Serialize and deserialize
--Customize the resulting instance

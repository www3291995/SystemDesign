Motivation

--Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
--Constructor is not descriptive
  --Name Mandated by name of containing type
  --Cannot overload with same sets arguments with different names
  --Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
--Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to
  --A separate function (Factory Method)
  --That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
  --Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory

Factory
--A component responsible soley for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects


Summary

--A factory method is a static method that creates objects
--A factory can take care of object creation
--A factory can be external or reside inside the object as an inner class
--Hierarchies of factories can be used to create related objects

Motivation

--Ordinary C# statements are perishable
	--Cannot undo a field/property assignment
	--Cannot directly serialize a sequence of actions (calls)
--Want an object that represents an operation
	--X should change its propert Y to Z
	--X should do W()
--Uses: GUI commands, multi-level undo/redo, macro recording and more!

Command
--An object which represents an instruction to perform a particular action. Contains 
  all the information necessary for the action to be taken.


Summary

--Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
--Define instruction for applying the command (either in the command itself, or elsewhere)
--Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
--Can create composite commands(a.k.a. macros)

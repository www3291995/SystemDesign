Motivation

--An object or system goes through changes
	--E.g., a bank account gets deposits and withdrawals
--There are different ways of navigating those changes
--One way is to record every change(Command) and teach a command to 'undo' itself
--Another is to simply save snapshots of the system


Memento
--A token/handle representing the system state. Let us roll back to the state when the token
  was generated. May or may not directly expose state information.


Summary

--Mementos are used to roll back states arbitrarily
--A memento is simply a token/handle class with(typically) no functions of its own
--A memento is not required to expose directly the state(s) to which it reverts the system
--Can be used to implement undo/redo

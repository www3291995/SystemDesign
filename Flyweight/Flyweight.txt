Motivation

--Avoid redundancy when storing data
--E.g., MMORPG
	--Plenty of users with identical first/last names
	--No sense in storing same first/last name over and over again
	--Store a list of names and pointers to them
--.NET performs string interning, so an identical string is stored only once
--E.g., bold or italic text in the console
	--Don't want each character to have a formatting character
	--Operate on rangs (e.g., line number, start/end positions)

Flyweight
--A space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects.

Summary

--Store common data externally
--Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogeneous collections and store data related to those ranges
--.Net string interning is the Flyweight pattern

--Electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements
	--Voltage (5V, 220V)
	--Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)
--We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
	--Some support possible (e.g., 120V/220V)
--Thus, we use a special device (an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

Adapter 
--A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y



Summary

--Implementing an Adapter is easy
--Determine the API you have and the API you need
--Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to, ...) the adaptee
--Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations

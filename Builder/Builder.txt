Motivation

--Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call
--Other objects require a lot of ceremony to creat
--Having an object with 10 constructor agruments is not productive
--Instead, opt for piecewise construction


Summary

--A builder is a seperate component for building an object
--Can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function
--To make builder fluent, return this
--Different facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class

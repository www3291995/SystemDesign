Motivation

--Balancing complexity and presentation/usability
--Typical home
	--Many subsystems(electrical, sanitation)
	--Complex internal structure(e.g., floor layers)
	--End user is not exposed to internals
--Same with software
	--Many systems working to provide flexibility, but...
	--API consumers want it to 'just work'


Facade
--Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code.


Summary

--Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes
--May wisht to (optionally) expose internals through the facade
--May allow users to 'escalate' to use more complex APIs if they need to
